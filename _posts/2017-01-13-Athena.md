We set out to bring Power BI Embedded analytics capabilities into a brand new ASP.NET web application for Athena Intelligence. 
RitterIM allows customers to manage quotes, sales, policies and geographic time-sensitive plans into their existing
quote engine application that store logging and audting information to Microsoft Azure.

Core team: 

- David Sypnieski - Founder, CEO, Athena Intelligence, Inc
- Tim Reilly ([@timmyreilly ](https://twitter.com/timmyreilly))- Technical Evangelist, Microsoft
- Heather Shapiro ([@microheather ](https://twitter.com/microheather))- Technical Evangelist, Microsoft
- Mostafa Elzoghbi ([@MostafaElzoghbi ](https://twitter.com/MostafaElzoghbi)) – Senior Technical Evangelist, Microsoft


Our solution required the creation of an interactive dashboard for quote engine users and a secure reporting system for customers of RitterIM quote engine application.
This involved the creation of a Power BI Embedded report that access data store in Azure storage account using Azure tables.
These reports were later integrated into an existing ASP.NET MVC 5 web application that runs in Microsoft Azure.  

## Customer profile ##

[Athena Intelligence, Inc.](http://www.RitterIM.com/) is a Field Marketing Organization (FMO) in the Senior Life and Health Insurance markets.
That means we promote and distribute insurance carriers’ products to licensed agents. But, we’re not your run-of-the-mill insurance marketing company.
We’re unique.


## Problem statement ##

RitterIM currently serves customers across the United States.  With customers in every region, their data grows at a rate proportional to active field agents.
Stakeholders would like to view information within this data in an interactive online dashboard that allows interactive queries for applications distributions.

This allows external customers a way to view the quote engine information and the areas, policies, plans and quotes that they are interested in.
  
In addition, RitterIM customers should be able to view similar information pertaining regions, plans and quotes to their local area by allowing this data to be accessed securely in their administration panel.  

In this way, a customer can view the performance of field agents as it relates to their business.  
This would allow the customer to assess the value of adopting RitterIM services in a quantifiable format.
It would also assist the customer by offering insights such as: customer traffic patterns, services of interest, earned revenues, and active system issues.

Athena Intelligence provides data services from the vast amounts of public data that we process and a business intelligence application that incorporates additional private data sources. 
Their business intelligence application makes it easy for companies and organizations managing food, water, or energy production to analyze the risks and opportunities in their supply chain by combining natural resource, processing/manufacturing, and production practice data. By enabling the utilization of existing data and allowing for easier capture of new data, we unlock the value in the supply chain's data and make it simple for companies to manage their resources more intelligently.

Athena Intelligence is looking to scale their applications using PowerBI embedded and Azure. They currently have a manual workflow for building charts but are seeing redundancies in workflows and would like to start leveraging the analytics, visualization, and authorization features of Power BI and Power BI Embedded. The Athena Intelligence platform will be used by external customers from farming industry to agricultural research.  

We will connect to Athena's existing PostgreSQL databases to import data into embedded Power BI reports to bring statistics about water usage and distribution across the state of California to their customers. These dashboards will be integrated into a new ASP.NET web application and connected to their existing website. 



## Solutions, steps, and delivery ##

1. Access the Azure tables data source. 

	The RitterIM quote engine relies on an ASP.NET MVC 5 application running on Microsoft Azure. Here is a depiction of the architecture employed:

	![Architecture](/images/RitterIM/Architecture.PNG) 


	This required working together with the RitterIM development team to share Azure storage account name and access key to access Azure storage account on their existing Azure subscription to allow importing their data into [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) for report development.  
  
    First, You need to select the Azure table as your data source of the report.

	![Connect to Azure Tables](/images/RitterIM/PBIToAzureTables.PNG) 

    Second, You need to provide the account name and the access key to access Azure table records in the Azure storage account.

2. Create the report.

	Our project requirements was to create a report that connects to Azure table storage and integrate it in the quote engine application.
    The existing dashboard can be seen below: 

	![Quote Engine Admin Roles](/images/RitterIM/AdminRoles.PNG) 

    ![Existing Dashboard](/images/RitterIM/ExistingDashboard.PNG) 

	We accomplished this by reviewing the ASP.NET MVC 5 source code for the existing dashboard to integrate the new dashboard into the existing navigation system.
 
    Upon connecting to the azure table, the Power BI desktop was showing only four columns.
    While using [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/) tool, I was seeing more columns in the target table.

    ![Azure table columns in Storage explorer tool](/images/RitterIM/AzureTableStorageExplorerView.PNG) 

    The Azure table contains a complex data type column that is of type **JSON**. We would like to expand the properties by adjusting the query.

    ![Azure table columns in Storage explorer tool](/images/RitterIM/OriginalQueryView.PNG) 

	We adjusted the query to include the attributes of the JSON column type. so we can the attributes of this column included in our report.

	We then set out to populate the dashboard with appropriate controls.  Our finished report in Power BI Desktop tool for RitterIM customers can be seen below:

	![RitterIMReport](/images/RitterIM/Report.PNG)  


3. Set up Power BI Embedded workspace in Microsoft Azure.

	We started by following the instructions in the [Get started with Power BI Embedded sample](https://Azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/power-bi-embedded-get-started-sample/).  This will walk through the creation of the workspace and how to upload projects into the workspace for access through Power BI Embedded.  Currently, these processes are handled through a **ProvisionSample** project contained in the link above:

	![Creating a workspace in an existing workspace collection](/images/RitterIM/CreatingNewWorkspace.PNG)


4. Embed report into existing ASP.NET MVC 5 application.

    
	We began by setting up a new PowerBIController within the existing web application.  Through this controller we are able to limit access to the RitterIM internal report.  In code, we create an embed token using:

	`var embedToken = PowerBIToken.CreateReportEmbedToken(this.workspaceCollection, this.workspaceId, report.Id);` 

	This allows us to view the embedded report within the existing website:

	![RitterIM Embedded](/images/RitterIM/RitterIMEmbedded.PNG)

	
    Now, We have integrated the developed Power BI report into the Quote Engine GitHub repository; this is available for application users. 
    All project code changes have been merged successfully in the product code base.

## General lessons ##

**Implementing the Power BI SDK into existing ASP.NET MVC 5 site:**

Bringing embedded reports into our existing ASP.NET MVC 5 site required the addition of the following Power BI NuGet package.

![Power BI NuGet Packages](/images/RitterIM/PowerBINuGetPackage.PNG)

Power BI desktop does not support direct query for Azure Tables, So we imported the azure table data which is more than **1 GB** into our Power BI report file (*.pbix).

![Azure Tables import process in Power BI desktop](/images/RitterIM/ImportAzureTable.PNG)

Since the Quote Engine uses a newer jquery library version 2.2.4 than the one that is used in the Microsoft sample application.
I was getting the following issue when rendering any Power BI Report in the application.

![Power BI Embedded rendering error](/images/RitterIM/select2_error_jquery_2.2.4.PNG)


I tracked all JavaScript dependencies that is needed to render a report successfully in the application.

Here is a list of added JavaScript libraries:
- bootstarp switch.
- dataTables.
- match height.
- select2.


Below code snippet shows the added scripts in the _Layout.cshtml before referencing Power BI js library:

```
    <!-- latest bootstrap-switch, matchHeight, dataTables, and Select2 releases -->
    <script src="https://rawgit.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/master/dist/js/bootstrap-switch.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.matchHeight/0.7.0/jquery.matchHeight-min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.12/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js"></script>
    <link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/select2/4.0.3/css/select2.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/select2/4.0.3/js/select2.min.js"></script>
```

To be able to use  HTML Power BI Extensions in any Razor view, I added the following configuration in views/web.config:

```
    <system.web>
    <compilation>
      <assemblies>
        <add assembly="Microsoft.PowerBI.AspNet.Mvc, Version=1.1.3.16224, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35"/>
      </assemblies>
    </compilation>
  </system.web>

```
