excerpt:Quantum is a start-up and focusing on providing the leading AR service across devices and product to help everyone knowing more, which include astronomy reality, cloud-based MR solution for smart home, and interactive control operation solution for any item. The CTO as one of founders shown this prototype to Satya Nadella with interacting with MS products, and got Satya highly recommendation. During the hackfest we helped they to develop a backend server to host their services, and a management portal for operators to configure system and update contents.

On Dec 6-8th, Microsoft Corp DX Technical Evangelist team with China DX Technical Evangelist team delivered our App Service Hackfest in Microsoft Beijing office. Microsoft teamed up with Quantum, an AR company focusing on astronomy teaching, developed a backend server to host their services, and a management portal for operators to configure system and update contents.

## Customer profile ##

Quantum is a start-up and focusing on providing the leading AR service across devices and product to help everyone knowing more, which include astronomy reality, cloud-based MR solution for smart home, and interactive control operation solution for any item. The CTO as one of founders shown this prototype to Satya Nadella with interacting with MS products, and got Satya highly recommendation. As they said, “Let everyone has their own planetary museum.”

## Problem statement ##

The client of AR system is a mobile app on iOS and Android which can add description and knowledge on the phone screen by rending a virtual planet on a physical ball. To support the expected user growth, they rely on a powerful and scalable backend to provide API service and content management. This backend 1) should support automatically scalable when large numbers of users use the product concurrently,  2) should have the ability to be debugged remotely when broken down to ensure the stability of the system, and 3) could be quickly swapped between test and production environment to have a rapid deployment and upgrade.


## Solution, steps, and delivery ##

To achieve above goals, we proposed to use .NET Core to develop all required service. Use App service to deploy the API server and management portal on Mooncake Web App. Leverage micro-services to build the architecture of the backend to make it more scalable. Storage data on a data layer consisting of Azure File storage and Azure SQL Database.

 ![App Service Architecture Draft](/images/2017-1-17-Quantum/quantum.jpg)

In this AR backend solution, Quantum will use the following Microsoft technologies:
- Azure App Service

- Azure SQL Database

- Azure File Storage

### Architecture ###
The Quantum backend architecture can be represented as follows:

 ![hackthon architecture ](/images/2017-1-17-Quantum/quantum.jpg)

 ![App Service Architecture Diagram](/images/2017-1-17-Quantum/architecture.png)

-	A management portal and mobile client use the gateway to call the different API Servers.
- An OpenID to verify the identification of the user by querying the data in SQL database.
- Two applications providing APIs including Web API for Apps and Management API.
- A static File server provide users with the files and data in Azure storage and SQL database
- A number of storage locations, including Azure Storage accounts and SQL Database.

### Code artifacts ###

Microsoft’s China DX Technical Evangelist team and the Quantum dev team split the engagement into following segments:
1.	Build API service to host management portal, management API and Web API.
2.	Build File Storage and SQL database.


#### Build APP Service to host management portal, management API and Web API.

As our Azure Web Apps supports “built-in auto-scale and load balancing” makes their developing job becomes easier and focusing the logic.

### Customer Feedback

*“With help of Microsoft, we built up the architecture of the backend, use micro-services to make it more scalable.” – Chen Zhang, Chief Engineer from Quantum*

## Conclusion ##

After 3 days of Hackfest, Quantum used App service deployed the API server and management portal on Mooncake Web App, which gives other AR companies have more choices when they try to build their own system. Microsoft Azure App service can be a very good choice with its easier developing and deploying facts and auto-scale benefits.

### Opportunities going forward: ##

During the hackfest, we happen to introduce the Microsoft Bot framework to our customers. As in AR system, voice and conversation has more advantages in interaction. So they may try adopting Microsoft bot technology and cognitive services for a more natural interaction between user and system in future
